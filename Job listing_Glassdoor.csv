Job Type: Full time; In-office Henderson, Nevada

Pay: $55,000 / year

Schedule: Full time

Job Description:

We are looking for a detail-oriented Data Entry Specialist to join our Venue Research team in Henderson, Nevada.

Who We Are

In 2007, two pretty sharp brothers decided to bootstrap a new business venture using their poker winnings to fund it. A week before inception, one brother got a fox red Labrador retriever puppy and named him Red. He quickly became the center of their universe and the name Red Dog Media was officially born.

Today, Red Dog Media focuses on internet marketing; specifically performance marketing, search engine marketing, landing page optimization, and conversion rate optimization. What started with four employees has grown to over 40 people over the past 15 years.

Culture + Core Values

Our core values are woven throughout our entire interview process in order to gauge whether a candidate is a good cultural fit. There are several initiatives that keep the core values at the forefront of our culture. A few examples are: being discussed in 6 month reviews; our employee appreciation program; and being an integrated part of our company’s operating system.

Our Core Values:

Be Curious - Having a high level of engagement; Digging into problems; Not being satisfied with good enough; Being open to new ideas; Not being a know-it-all.

Be a Problem Solver - This is what separates the doers from the dreamers. It’s about executing and getting the important stuff done. A problem solver prioritizes, organizes, and simplifies. They are detail-oriented to make sure it's done right.

Be a Championship Teammate - While a ""team player"" is collegial, a champion teammate is much more. They have the drive to succeed, work hard, come prepared, hold themselves accountable to high standards, elevate those around them, and are coachable.

Be Better Than Yesterday - Do you bring more skills to the table today than a year ago? How do you plan to be better a year from now? We work in a fast-paced competitive industry. If we stagnate, we’ll get left behind. This applies at the company and personal level. Growth and improvement need not be only in technical skill sets; personal growth can be even more valuable. We embrace positive change and stretch ourselves to grow both personally and professionally.

About Rio Tinto

Every idea, every innovation, every little thing the world calls ‘progress’ begins with
a first step, and someone willing to take it: explorers, inventors, entrepreneurs. Pioneers.

For nearly 150 years, Rio Tinto has been a company of pioneers – generations of people spanning the globe, all with the grit and vision to produce materials essential to human progress.

Our iron ore has shaped skylines from Shanghai to Sydney. Our aluminium – the world’s first to be certified “responsible” – helps planes fly and makes cars lighter. Our copper helps wind turbines power cities and our boron helps feed the world and explore the universe.
Our diamonds help us celebrate the best parts of life.

Where you’ll be working

Once in operation, Resolution Copper has the potential to supply nearly 25% of US copper demand and create several thousand direct and indirect jobs in the Pioneer Mining District of Arizona, with an economic value estimated at several billion dollars over the mine life.

The project will rely on a block caving technique to extract the deposit that lies more than 2,000 metres below the surface. This method uses gravity to remove the ore and is the most viable way to recover the resource.

In 2019, the project achieved a significant milestone – issuance of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) by the US Forest Service (USFS). Resolution Copper continues permitting and community engagement activities, shaft and underground development studies, and advancing data collection to further orebody knowledge.

Every Voice Matters

We are committed to an inclusive environment where people feel comfortable to be themselves. We want our people to feel that all voices are heard, all cultures respected and that a variety of perspectives are not only welcome – they are essential to our success. We treat each other fairly and with dignity regardless of race, gender, nationality, ethnic origin, religion, age, sexual orientation or anything else that makes us different.
