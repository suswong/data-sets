Accuhealth was formed when a group of cybersecurity professionals teamed up with a medical director to reinvent the healthcare experience for physicians and patients completely. Traditional primary care experience, mired with inefficiencies, long wait times, crowded offices, exposure concerns, and questionable health outcomes, was ready for a paradigm change. After a thorough analysis of the telehealth marketplace, it was clear that current solutions fell short of meeting Accuhealth's vision.","

        ","Endeavor is the world’s foremost community of high-growth entrepreneurs. With offices in 30+ countries around the world, our 1,500+ entrepreneurs include over 50 unicorns that rely on Endeavor’s unparalleled network of peers and mentors to solve their toughest challenges. Portfolio companies include Checkout.com (UAE), Carsome (Malaysia), and Rappi (Colombia).

We are looking for a tech & systems enthusiast who can build the workflows and rollout the tools that capture institutional knowledge and disseminate it across Endeavor’s 500+ worldwide Staff. This means working with our programmatic data, our investment data, our marketing data, our think-tank data, and more. Your ultimate mission is to make Endeavor the most tech-forward, data-informed community of entrepreneurs possible. This is a management level position, reporting directly to the CFO and will oversee three primary areas of responsibility:

Data Governance: With 41 semi-independent offices, data uniformity is an uphill challenge. The Head of Data Analytics will establish the governance system and communication cadence to ensure data quality and ownership. You will create a culture where data is commonly viewed as being a model citizen of Endeavor. To help them do this, the Head of Data Analytics will manage two Salesforce Administrators and lean on evangelists in our local operations to affect this change.
Data infrastructure & visualization: For much of its existence, Endeavor relied on Salesforce exclusively to capture and visualize data. In 2022, this changed. Our data sources proliferated and the SaaS tools evolved. We introduced Snowflake and expanded our usage of Tableau. The Head of Data Analytics will orchestrate the integration, transformation, and utilization of these varied data sources to inform Endeavor operations. The Head of Data Analytics will manage a BizOps manager and lean on evangelists in our local operations to affect this change.
Open, Endeavor’s proprietary system: Open is a proprietary directory that connects Endeavor’s 7,000+ strong community of entrepreneurs and mentors. The Head of Data Analytics will oversee the development and adoption of the platform, ensuring its evolution accelerates Endeavor’s strategy. They will manage one Product Manager and a team of external developers, and lean on evangelists in our local operations to affect this change.


Here’s what we expect of you within your first year…

90 Days: You understand the organization, the core business processes and workflows, how our tooling supports these workflows, and what gaps remain. With this understanding, you have scoped a Platform strategy for the remainder of 2023.
180 Days: You have built and rolled out your first data products and Open features. You identified clear metrics for what constitutes success for these products and features and have conducted a postmortem on why these products did or did not succeed. You understand the largest obstacles to strong data governance at Endeavor, and have designed at least one initiative to overcome this.
365 Days: Your comfort with Endeavor’s operations and tech stack allows you to map out a three-year Endeavor Platform strategy.


Requirements

As a values-based company, we require someone who is...

Entrepreneur First: You are mission-oriented and believe in Endeavor’s model to change the world through high-impact entrepreneurship
Go Big: You are someone whose curiosity drives them to dream (and execute!) big as Endeavor reimagines its service offerings to entrepreneurs
Network of Trust: You’re great with people! You naturally build and maintain relationships with key players and have the superior interpersonal skills needed to build trust with our entrepreneurs, mentors, and teams in over 40 markets.
Pay It Forward: You’re someone with a service-oriented attitude, who asks “What can I do?” before asking “What can I get?”
One Endeavor: You’re comfortable working across cultures and will thrive on working with colleagues in 40+ markets.
Always Agile: You believe in the importance of planning but never hesitate to change plans in the face of new data and circumstances


You also have the following more traditional requirements:

7+ years of experience at a tech or tech-oriented company or cutting-edge non-profit.
Experience managing a team is a must.
Experience with Salesforce, Snowflake, SQL, dbt, Tableau, and Fivetran is a must.
A unique blend of patience and urgency. You will need patience to acquire the buy-in of cross-functional and cross-continental stakeholders. You will need an urgency to craft a vision of a tech-enabled Endeavor and start building toward that future immediately.
Resourcefulness. In 2022, Endeavor invested more in its tech and data stack than it ever has before. We expect this trajectory to continue. However, we are not a “traditional” tech company, and with limited resources you will need to roll up your sleeves and be creative.
Experience working in an international environment is a plus


Benefits

Competitive salary: The base salary for the Head of Data Analytics ranges from $120,000 - 150,000 with generous bonus opportunities. Actual starting base pay will be determined base on skills, experience, and other non-discriminatory factors permitted by law.
Work with 500+ of the smartest, most affable, most curious teammates in 30+ countries
International travel opportunities to meet these teammates!
Very competitive benefits package, including free healthcare coverage for dependents & up to 5% 401K matching

Description

About this role

Since our founding 30 years ago, BlackRock has brought together great minds to drive innovation. From the beginning, we have been demonstrating technology for insight and efficiency to make our business better and to help clients realize the objectives they desire. In 2018 BlackRock accelerated innovation and technology again with additional investment in artificial intelligence and data science and all the potential they represent.

The AI Labs was formed to act as a central hub with a firm-wide remit to solve strategic business challenges for the firm by bringing to bear our expertise in machine learning, artificial intelligence, data science and optimization. Our mission is to combine human and machine intelligence to revolutionize asset management.

We are a hybrid research and product team and have a responsibility to drive towards commercial impact in the form of alpha generation, operational efficiencies, and cost reduction. Building on the success of systematic investment teams with a history of demonstrating machine learning at BlackRock to create alpha, the goal was to apply these same techniques throughout the business.

Job Description

As a researcher, you will collaborate with a distributed team of world-class academics, engineers, and investment professionals to develop methodologies for products solving a corporate-wide set of client, investor, and operational problems. Products developed often demonstrate multiple disciplines, including statistics, machine learning, and optimization, and combine original methods with innovative solutions available in industry and academia. You will be responsible for the entire research lifecycle, from initial research and prototyping, to iterating on the system methodology, to detailing the final product and clearing internal review processes.

Responsibilities

Work with partners to translate business needs into well-scoped technical projects.
Efficiently interact with large and complex datasets to evaluate technical methodologies.
Rapidly prototype technical solutions implementing groundbreaking tools from optimization and machine learning.
Produce technical whitepapers and make clear technical presentations to senior management.
Work with engineers and partners to build product-ionized solutions that are reliable, scalable, and operate in compliance with firm-wide processes.

Qualifications

Either a PhD in a quantitative subject area (computer science, mathematics, statistics, economics, physics, engineering, or related field), or
An MS degree in a quantitative field plus 3+ years of professional experience in optimization, machine learning, statistics, exploratory data analysis, and other aspects of the data science process.
Strong theoretical background in and practical experience using optimization, statistical techniques, and machine learning, preferably proven through academic publications or open-source codebases.
Strong familiarity with programming languages such as Python, Julia, or R.
Experience with the analysis or application of data in finance, economics, sociology, or related fields is a plus.

For California only the salary range for this position is $128,250 - $145,000. Additionally, employees are eligible for an annual discretionary bonus, and benefits including heath care, leave benefits, and retirement benefits. BlackRock operates a pay-for-performance compensation philosophy and your total compensation may vary based on role, location, and firm, department and individual performance.

Our Benefits

To help you stay energized, engaged and inspired, we offer a wide range of benefits including a strong retirement plan, tuition reimbursement, comprehensive healthcare, support for working parents and Flexible Time Off (FTO) so you can relax, recharge and be there for the people you care about.

Our hybrid work model

BlackRock’s current hybrid work model is designed to enable in-person connections and collaboration that is core to our culture, while supporting increased flexibility for all employees. In line with local health guidance and regulations, employees are required to work at least 3 days in the office each week, with the flexibility to work from home up to 2 days a week. Some business groups may require more time in the office due to their roles and responsibilities. The health, safety and well-being of our people will always be our top priorities; we will continue to monitor local conditions and health advisories in making decisions about our work environments.

About BlackRock

At BlackRock, we are all connected by one mission: to help more and more people experience financial well-being. Our clients, and the people they serve, are saving for retirement, paying for their children’s educations, buying homes and starting businesses. Their investments also help to strengthen the global economy: support businesses small and large; finance infrastructure projects that connect and power cities; and facilitate innovations that drive progress.

This mission would not be possible without our smartest investment – the one we make in our employees. It’s why we’re dedicated to creating an environment where our colleagues feel welcomed, valued and supported with networks, benefits and development opportunities to help them thrive.

        ","Ocean Associates Inc. (OAI) is seeking applicants for a full-time position to provide ecosystem reporting support to the Ecosystem Dynamics and Assessment Branch of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center, within NOAA Fisheries. OAI is a Virginia corporation established in 2003 that provides consulting and technical services to the U.S. government, non-governmental organizations, international organizations, and the private sector. We specialize in scientific program and project management, strategic planning, professional and technical services and stakeholder engagement, supporting government contracts.

Description

NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is responsible for the conservation and management of our Nation’s living marine resources and their habitats. By developing high quality science and supporting an ecosystem-based approach to management, NMFS provides important services to the Nation, including sustainable fisheries, healthy ecosystems, safe seafood, and protected species recovery.

The U.S. leads the world in sustainable fisheries management; as a result, U.S. fisheries are highly valuable and make large contributions to the U.S. economy. Under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA), NMFS works with the eight regional Fishery Management Councils (FMCs) to provide scientific advice on the ~500 federally-managed fish stocks. NMFS stock assessments and other science products are critically important to sustainable fisheries management for assessing the status of fish stocks and predicting future harvest levels, setting sustainable catch limits, and reducing bycatch.

NMFS recently codified its commitment to Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management (EBFM) with the release of their EBFM policy and subsequent EBFM Roadmap. The EBFM Policy establishes a framework of guiding principles to “enhance and accelerate the implementation of EBFM within NOAA Fisheries, and in cooperation with NOAA Fisheries partners.” These guiding principles are: implement ecosystem-level planning, advancing our understanding of ecosystem processes, prioritizing vulnerabilities and risk of ecosystems and their components, explore and address trade-offs within an ecosystem, incorporate ecosystem considerations into management advice, and maintain resilient ecosystems.

The Ecosystem Dynamics and Assessment Branch (EDAB) conducts a research program focused on developing ecosystem-level knowledge and advice to support informed decision-making. Research conducted by the Branch encompasses climate science, ecology, process-oriented ecosystem research, and marine population dynamics and ecosystem modeling.

The Branch is responsible for conducting analyses of the effects of natural and anthropogenic pressures on the Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (NES LME). EDAB also develops and applies ecosystem and statistical models to synthesize information on climate, oceanographic, and human-related pressures. These products are provided to a variety of entities to inform decision-making and to support the implementation of regional and national EBFM. These entities include NOAA, other federal and state agencies, Regional Fishery Management Councils (hereafter, Councils), Marine Fisheries Commissions, research colleagues, nongovernmental organizations, national and international treaty organizations in which the U.S. participates, and the fishing industry (both commercial and recreational).

One of the focal areas of EDAB is Ecosystem Reporting where this position will be focused. The Branch develops several documents reporting ecosystem status and trends (e.g., State of the Ecosystem reports for the two regional councils, Ecosystem Status Report, Current Conditions, Ecosystem Context for Stock Advice, and others). These documents provide climate, environmental, and ecosystem considerations targeted to specific audiences to support individual stock advice, specification setting, and as general communication tools to the general public. Collectively, these documents serve as the backbone of Integrated Ecosystem Assessments (IEAs). The reports describe environmental, social, and economic states and their potential impacts on commercially important fish species, protected species, and the NES LME. These synthesis products are important in supporting ecosystem-level advice critical to NMFS, Councils, stakeholders, and other decision-makers.

Data used in ecosystem reporting incorporates a wide range of disciplines. These reports typically contain climate and oceanographic information such as global climate and regional model outputs, satellite sea surface temperature and ocean color data, as well as observations from ongoing hydrographic and plankton surveys. They also contain relevant data from other fisheries independent and dependent sources such as fish and protected species surveys, and commercial landings data. Ecosystem reporting also attempts to capture human dimensions through social and economic data related to Northeast U.S. Coastal communities.

Additionally, the Branch supports a defined process for evaluating and operationalizing new analyses and data for inclusion in ecosystem reporting products to improve generality, accessibility, testing, documentation, and best practices.

Tasks

The task includes the following:

Coordinate and facilitate implementation of ecosystem reporting projects.Organize and facilitate workshops as needed.

Assist with planning and logistics of program and project team meetings/workshops and help develop agendas, written documents, meeting minutes, presentations, or other materials as required.

DATA TECHNICIAN I




PI: Dr. Stephen Freedland




The Institute for Medical Research, a nonprofit organization that conducts cutting edge research for the Durham VA Health Care System (DVAHCS), is seeking to hire a Data Technician I. This position is ideal for a highly motivated individual who may be taking time off between degrees or programs with an interest in clinical research. The successful candidate will be employed in the laboratory of Dr. Stephen Freedland, a nationally recognized leader in urology research and associate at the Durham-based Urology Research Lab. The Freedland Urology Research Group primarily examines prostate and bladder cancer in veterans with a focus on lifestyle, race, and risk stratification, and is supported by numerous federal grants as well as leading industry sponsors.




The Data Technician is involved with the acquisition and maintenance of large amounts of clinical data. The work engages multiple skills across a wide range of active projects. These multiple functions require a significant degree of flexibility and critical thinking to complete complex tasks. This position is also an opportunity to work with a highly productive and dynamic team of MDs, PhDs, and research scientists. The candidate will gain considerable knowledge of clinical research methods, the field of urology, as well as have access to a variety of educational experiences and professional development. Previous data techs have been able to shadow in the operating room, attend seminars, and after the first 12 months of employment participate in academic manuscript development resulting in first authorship.




Responsibilities




Data Abstraction




Assist in maintaining a vast quantity of patient-oriented data used in support of analytical and/or research projects related to urology.
Review electronic and paper medical records for medical information and conduct electronic database entry.




Quality and Compliance




Perform efficient and accurate data abstraction and entry into database systems.
Adhere to internal standards of procedure, good clinical practice, and other IMR/VA policies.
Maintain patient confidentiality.




Team Work and Motivation




Work effectively with other team members as part of a team.
Complete tasks independently and manage personal workflow.
Communicate effectively with team members in both a written and oral manner.




Non-critical Elements




Troubleshoot and modify protocol implementation when necessary.
Recommend new methods for data collection and documentation.
Assist other research personnel.




Qualifications/Experience: Applicants must have a bachelor's degree and possess strong interpersonal and communication skills. They must be reliable, self-motivated, detailed-oriented and extremely organized. Data technicians are required to manage the workflow of multiple projects accurately within a fast-paced environment. They may be required to sit for long periods of time in front of computers and to occasionally lift-up to 40 pounds. English proficiency and basic computer skills are required; familiarity with MS Excel and Access is preferred. Employees must reside in North Carolina. This is a remote position but requires availability to attend meetings at the Durham, NC office.




The prior statements describe the general nature and level of work being performed. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all responsibilities and duties required. Employees may be directed to perform job-related tasks other than those specifically presented in this description.




Pay Rate: Non-negotiable pay is $21.00 per hour.




Start Date: Expected start date will be 4- 6 weeks after the offer but is somewhat flexible and contingent upon completion and processing of VA paperwork.




Supervisory Controls: The Clinical Research Coordinator, under the direction of the Principal Investigator, is responsible for the overall supervision and workload of the data technician. This position will, however, report directly to the Clinical Trials Assistant Team Lead and their work may be reviewed by other members of the research team.




Employee Benefits: IMR offers a competitive benefits package which includes health insurance, a matching 403b retirement savings plan, and paid holiday, vacation, and sick leave. Please visit www.imr.org for information about employee benefits.




All IMR employees are required to obtain a Workers Without Compensation (WOC) appointment at the Durham VA Health Care System (DVAHCS). As a result, the successful candidate must undergo a federal background check and may be subject to a drug test. Participation in the vaccination programs may be required for all Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care Workers Without Compensation (WOC) appointments. We will not sponsor applicants for work visas.




Equal Opportunity Employer, including disabled persons and Veterans.

BSD SUR - Section Administrator: OHNS - Thirty Million Words: Research Analysis




About The Department




The TMW Center for Early Learning + Public Health (TMW Center) is a joint venture between The University of Chicago Biological Sciences Division and the Division of the Social Sciences. It develops science-based interventions, tools, and technologies to help parents and caregivers interact with young children in ways that maximize brain development. A rich language environment is critical for healthy brain development, however there are no universal and standardized measurement tools capable of quantifying the quality of these environments at scale and with high accuracy. Access to this type of data could allow caregivers to enhance children’s language environments in real-time, give policymakers insights into how to design policies that have a population-level impact, and advance the science of early skill formation. To fill this gap, the TMW Center is developing an AI-driven wearable device to reliably and accurately assess children’s early language environments at home or at school. Our device is like a ‘Fitbit’ for child development; it will be connected to a smartphone app that will provide personalized, real-time feedback to empower parents and educators to create the best language environment for their children. We are looking for a talented data scientist to join our team and help us build high-quality algorithms for the development of the device. Previous experience and coursework in machine learning and Python are necessary.

Parsley Health is a digital health company with a mission to transform the health of everyone, everywhere with the world's best possible medicine. Today, Parsley Health is the nation's largest health care company helping people suffering from chronic conditions find relief with root cause resolution medicine. Our work is inspired by our members’ journeys and our actions are focused on impact and results.




The Opportunity




Parsley Health is hiring a Director of Business Operations to help shape the strategy, operations, and culture at Parsley Health. We are growing and scaling our business and we need strong cross-functional execution to build a new type of healthcare company.




The primary goal of the role is smooth, well-informed internal operations, including everything from ownership of our OKR process, specific cross team OKRs and initiatives, cross team communication, and company-wide accountability and ownership. In addition you will serve as a key member of the executive team where your role will be ensuring important strategic and operational pieces are executed with high fidelity and that stakeholders across the executive team and the broader company are communicated to and held accountable to deliverables.




Other specific ownership areas include running the executive team’s rhythm, convening and steering the broader leadership group, driving cross-company business operations, and identifying and directing new projects for the company.




This role will expose you to the full breadth of company departments and decisions, offering opportunities for you to make an impact big and small. As a part of our matrixed environment, you will serve as connective tissue and identify company needs.




What You’ll Do




Executive Leadership: plan and run the executive team meeting rhythm to help our senior team stay aligned and accountable, find resolutions quickly, improve business outcomes, and work well across the company
Leadership Alignment: gather the broader leadership group across the company for connectivity and collaboration, ultimately improving cross-company performance
Operations: spearhead and lead the company’s quarterly and annual planning cycles to efficiently set goals and effectively communicate direction for the whole company; develop and improve other company systems for better communication, alignment, and empowerment
Strategic Direction: coming out of planning discussions, make recommendations on longer-term business plans and their impact on the organization
Project Execution: identify and run special projects, collaborate with finance and data team on creating models and business case framework, and owning execution that help push the company forward in new ways
While needs will evolve over time, we expect this role will be allocated ~45% to executive and leadership team success, ~45% to company business operations, and ~10% to special projects




What You’ll Need




6+ years of work experience in a mixture of consulting, operations, and strategic roles; startup experience is key
Successful track record driving change cross-functionally through influential leadership
Exceptional structured thinking and organization skills for yourself, and broader team process building skills that balance effort with return
Bias for action and sense of urgency - you will help the company’s executive team make choices and move faster
Strong analytical skills (Excel and Looker proficiency is preferred)
Strong verbal and written communication skills
Comfort operating in ambiguity
Scale-up healthtech experience is a nice-to-have




Benefits And Compensation




Equity Stake
401(k) + Employer Matching program
Remote-first with the option to work from one of our centers in NYC or LA
Complimentary Parsley Health Complete Care membership
Subsidized Medical, Dental, and Vision insurance plan options
Generous 4+ weeks of paid time off
Annual professional development stipend




Parsley Health is committed to providing an equitable, fair and transparent compensation program for all employees.




The starting salary for this role is between $148,750 - $175,000, depending on skills and experience. We take a geo-neutral approach to compensation within the US, meaning that we pay based on job function and level, not location.




Individual compensation decisions are based on a number of factors, including experience level, skillset, and balancing internal equity relative to peers at the company. We expect the majority of the candidates who are offered roles at our company to fall healthily throughout the range based on these factors. We recognize that the person we hire may be less experienced (or more senior) than this job description as posted. If that ends up being the case, the updated salary range will be communicated with candidates during the process.




At Parsley Health we believe in celebrating everything that makes us human and are proud to be an equal opportunity workplace. We embrace diversity and are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. We believe that the more inclusive we are, the better we can serve our members.

We look forward to connecting!

        ","About Phaidra

Phaidra is building the future of industrial automation.

The world today is filled with static, monolithic infrastructure. Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.

Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:

The intelligence is provided by reinforcement learning algorithms, which convert raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions.
We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning.
We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them.


Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.

        About PhaidraPhaidra is building the future of industrial automation.The world today is filled with static, monolithic infrastructure. Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time.

        ","Have you wanted to experience a start-up environment? Are you motivated by work that makes a difference? Good news:

Speak4 is looking for an organized team-player and personable Partner Success Associate to join our growing team.

The Company:

Speak4 is a technology start-up that makes it simple for organizations to empower their supporters to speak up for causes they believe in via an innovative, frictionless digital advocacy platform. Speak4 was created by a team of experienced marketers, skilled technologists and award-winning digital strategists who wanted a better tool to help organizations mobilize grassroots support online.

The Candidate:

The ideal candidate will have experience in the digital, marketing or advocacy spaces with a zeal for making a difference with high caliber work. They thrive on the frontlines of our business, supporting partners with best-in-class advocacy tools and strategic performance recommendations. Never one to shy away from a crisis, they enjoy troubleshooting on the spot with a calm, cool and collected demeanor.

This position is based in Arlington, VA with the option for remote work.

Your day in this position may include:

Fielding partner support requests, ranging from new campaign implementation to reporting questions. You’re comfortable juggling multiple balls at once and have a knack for prioritizing on the spot.
Drafting product updates and implementation guides for partners to leverage the platform’s latest tools and capabilities.
Partnering with sales to provide a well-rounded onboarding experience for new partners to support their unique advocacy efforts with seamless campaign set-up.
Collaborating with marketing to develop new feature collateral and refine existing onboarding and guided implementation collateral. You’re the #1 advocate for our partners internally and work to get them the information they need before they ask for it.
And more! The last thing you will hear any teammate say is “That’s not my job!” and that’s what we’re looking for from you too.


Requirements

This job may be for you, if you:

Consider yourself a professional “crisis-fighter”. You know what it’s like to be in our partner’s position and remain calm, cool and collected while troubleshooting the biggest (and smallest) problems alike.
Derive motivation from problem-solving and enjoy finding the best solution for our partners with the least amount of time and friction. You’re a pro at recalling previous solutions that might work for new requests and know how to clearly communicate internally when your stumped or need a hand.
Know it’s all about the tone. Whether in-person or in writing, you’re personable and experienced at developing a strong rapport with a diverse group of individuals.
Are comfortable communicating with a wide range of stakeholders, from data analysts to C-Suite executives. You can get nerdy with numbers, while also summarizing the toplines to get your point across, no matter the audience.
Are a self-starter who enjoys streamlining processes to work smarter, not just harder. You want to stay busy with the work that will have the greatest impact for your team and the company.
Look for opportunities to improve in every situation, offering and accepting candid feedback constantly.


What we require:

You need to understand how Speak4 fits into the bigger digital marketing picture, which is why we’re asking for at least 1 year of experience in digital marketing, politics, advocacy, or public affairs.
Partner success isn’t for the faint of heart. We’re looking for a demonstrated support associate with experience on the frontlines in a customer success or customer service role. Quality over quantity!
We’re a digital-first tool and digital-first team. You will need strong computer literacy with experience using Microsoft and Google products, with familiarity with HubSpot (or equivalent CRM’s), Asana (or equivalent task management tools) and Slack.
You’re well organized and responsible. Our team hustles hard and balances multiple priorities at once, and we need a teammate willing to jump in from the start.
You’re a team player with excellent verbal and written communication skills. There’s no questioning where you are or what you’re working on – you’re in the mix and ready to help.

Competitive compensation with opportunity for merit-based bonus pay.
Flexible vacation policy, with generous flex time scheduled around the holidays.

Then, the Analytics reporting solution needs to be built either using cloud-based Google Looker or Microsoft Power BI or another similar tool.

We collect data from a wide variety of data sources and the day-to-day ranges from conducting ad-hoc analysis and investigations, communicating with business partners across the organization, creating dashboards, and crafting database queries. The ideal candidate will be data-driven, curious, and a clear communicator.




Responsibilities




Be the operational data domain expert and develop metrics, reporting, and recommendations to assist in making data-driven decisions
Help support supply and demand forecasting and the design and monitoring of experiments
Highlight insights and recommendations from tying together our veterinary professional consultations with key user journeys
Deliver results and presentations to multiple levels of stakeholders
Identify areas for data improvements and work with the Operations, Product, Engineering, and Data Engineering teams to implement them


What We're Looking For




3+ years experience using data to improve operational performance
Strong SQL and Google Sheets (or Excel) skills
Experience building dashboards with a BI tool (we use Tableau)
Experience with marketplace data and supply & demand forecasting
Hands-on experience working with a modern data stack (we use Snowflake, DBT, Tableau, and Amplitude)
Experience and comfort working in a fast-paced environment
Very strong attention to detail
Strong written and verbal communication skills
Scripting ability in languages like Python or R is a plus


We know that great work comes from great, and inclusive teams. At Fuzzy, we specifically look for individuals of varying strengths, skills, backgrounds, and ideas. We believe this gives us a competitive advantage to better serve our members and helps us all grow as Fuzzyrs and individuals.

        ","The Company




Fuzzy is a health and wellness pet company building for the pet parent. We’re changing the way pet parents think about caring for their pets, looking to empower the pet parent by putting caring for our pets on autopilot. At Fuzzy, we work every day to make veterinary care more accessible. Of the 200 million dogs and cats in the US, more than 100 million receive no veterinary care.




Through technology we’re creating a different type of relationship between vets and pet parents - one that is personal, empowering, and for the long haul.




The Role




We’re looking for a Senior Data Analyst to support and enable our Operations team. This role will report to our VP of Data and partner closely with our Digital Health and Member Experience Operations teams to improve reporting and forecasting capabilities, monitor new experiments and initiatives, and drive optimizations.




Our Data Science team partners with teams across the company to better understand our users, measure what they’re doing within our web and mobile apps, how our veterinary professionals can best help those users, and identify new opportunities for retention, growth, and optimization.




We collect data from a wide variety of data sources and the day-to-day ranges from conducting ad-hoc analysis and investigations, communicating with business partners across the organization, creating dashboards, and crafting database queries. The ideal candidate will be data-driven, curious, and a clear communicator.




Responsibilities




Be the operational data domain expert and develop metrics, reporting, and recommendations to assist in making data-driven decisions
Help support supply and demand forecasting and the design and monitoring of experiments
Highlight insights and recommendations from tying together our veterinary professional consultations with key user journeys
Deliver results and presentations to multiple levels of stakeholders
Identify areas for data improvements and work with the Operations, Product, Engineering, and Data Engineering teams to implement them


What We're Looking For




3+ years experience using data to improve operational performance
Strong SQL and Google Sheets (or Excel) skills
Experience building dashboards with a BI tool (we use Tableau)
Experience with marketplace data and supply & demand forecasting
Hands-on experience working with a modern data stack (we use Snowflake, DBT, Tableau, and Amplitude)
Experience and comfort working in a fast-paced environment
Very strong attention to detail
Strong written and verbal communication skills
Scripting ability in languages like Python or R is a plus


We know that great work comes from great, and inclusive teams. At Fuzzy, we specifically look for individuals of varying strengths, skills, backgrounds, and ideas. We believe this gives us a competitive advantage to better serve our members and helps us all grow as Fuzzyrs and individuals.




We hire candidates of any race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, marital or family status, disability, veteran status, and any other status. Fuzzy is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer and will consider qualified applicants with criminal histories in a manner consistent with the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance. If you have a disability or special need that requires accommodation, please let us know.","
